Object Oriented Programming (OOP's)

Object-Oriented Programming is a method of implementation in which programmes are organised as 
cooperative collection collections oof objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, 
and whose classes are all members of a heirarchyof classes united via inheritance realtionship.

 Basic Concepts Of OOP

 1) Data Abstraction
    Abstraction is the concept of simplifying a real world concept into its essential elements. 
    Basically, you know only the essential things to operate.

2) Encapsulation
    Most fundamental concept of OOP. It is the way of combining both the data and the functions that 
    operate on that data under a single unit.

3) Modularity
    Partitioning a program into individual components.
    ->it reduces complexity 
    ->it creates a number of well-defined, documented boundaries withini the program.

4) Inheritance
    Inheritance is the capability of one class of things to inherit capabilities or properties from another
    class.
    
5) Polymorphism
    Polymorphism is the ability for a message or data to be processed in more than one way.
    Polymorphism is a property by which the same message can be sent to objects of several different classes,
    and each object can respond in a different way depending on its class.
